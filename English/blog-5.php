          <p>We think that our present era is an information age, but truth be told, we live in a communication age that brings the world closer with every given moment.</p>
          <p>But what is communication? Why is it important? Do we underestimate the importance of personal communication? How to overcome barriers to communication in business and personal lives?</p>
          <p>Communication means to participate. A good communicator can be a good leader. Simply put, communication is a process where we try as clearly and accurately as we can, to convey our thoughts, intentions and objectives.</p>
          <p>Communication is essential in every phase of life, especially in one's professional life. When one enters professional life, we immerse ourselves in the jargon and principles of our chosen field and obediently follow precepts laid out by our respective priesthoods. Yet rarely does one put serious effort toward expressing ourselves in a language that can be understood by those outside our tribe. Then we wonder why the efforts and achievements fail to resonate.</p>
          <p>If your ideas are clear, communication becomes more effective. But if you lack the confidence, your message will not get the desired impact. To do this, it is essential that one speaks confidently and politely - getting the message across clearly without causing confusion or offence. Lacking self-confidence hampers communication.</p>
          <p>Communication is not limited to boundaries, cultures and nationalities. ZEE believes in this dictum and creates quality, simple and relatable viewing content that transcends global languages, cultures and boundaries.</p>
          <p>Zee News - the first private Hindi News channel was spearheaded by my aim to broadcast the simplified version of the news content in the national language across the length and breadth of the country. Even though I met with initial criticism, I received critical acclaim for his initiative later.</p>
          <p>But is social media communication more effective than face to face or one on one communication? </p>
          <p>Communication gap results in generation gap. Technology might not be able to fill the generation gap. Parents may not be able to understand youth's behavioural pattern which needs to be accepted by youth. And elders need to understand that youth are ahead of their time.</p>
          <p>Communication can make bridges or break them. After all, what one needs to always remember is good communication skills is the key to success in life, work and relationships. With the right communication one can reach higher levels of mutual understanding and cooperation while successfully attaining their goals.</p>
