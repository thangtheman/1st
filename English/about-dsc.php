A leader, who has the power to fight against all odds, and to solve the challenges faced by the nation. A leader, who has immensely contributed to India&rsquo;s liberalization story in the early 90s, by gifting the nation, not just its first private satellite television channel, but an entire industry in itself, creating millions of jobs.</p>
          <p> DSC&rsquo;s wisdom, determination, and vision has immense potential to empower every Indian, in the pursuit of bringing in a paradigm shift in the perception levels of our country; and a much required change across the nation. </p>

          <h3>DSC’s Message to the Nation</h3>
          <br/>
          <p>India has immense potential to rise up as a global super power and the youth of our nation is the driving force to achieve the same. I take immense pride in being an Indian first, and I envision our nation to thrive up, against all odds and challenges. As a citizen of the nation, it is my duty and responsibility to work towards eradicating the challenges faced by my fellow citizens; which are restricting the growth towards rising up and shining bright on the global stage.</p>
          <p> I have always advised the youth of our nation, that their productivity and chances of achieving success, substantially increase, if Honesty is the epicenter of one&rsquo;s efforts. So with complete Honesty and Integrity, I take up the responsibility to prepare today&rsquo;s youth for a better tomorrow. And I firmly believe that the time is now. It is time for the non productive elements like corruption and fraudulence to be wiped off completely from the nation. It is time to redefine the word politics for the nation. It is time to make public service the focal point of our attention. And for this to happen, we all must start NOW.</p>
           <p> It pains me a lot to see the opportunities being missed by young and potential citizens of our nation, purely due to lack of confidence and determination. It pains me to see that there are still such heavy number of innocent lives, which are deprived of basic amenities. Young and potential minds across the nation, especially in the rural areas are not being optimally utilized to uplift our nation. There is a strong lack of confidence, determination and most above a burning desire to contribute towards your nation. It is utmost critical for the nation to come together and fight against these hindrances. One needs to create awareness amongst the youth to discover and aptly estimate their potential. If one has a strong determination and belief in oneself first, and then in one&rsquo;s dreams; there is nothing in this world which can stop you. </p>
         <div class="additional-info" id="t2"><p> As a responsible citizen of the nation first, and then as a leader; I have taken up the owness, to bring about this level of awareness and change amongst the society, especially the youth. For I firmly believe that my experience, expertise and knowledge gained, empowers me to deliver. Having established what I have till date, I am now giving substantial time towards the socio-economic well being of the society. But I surely cannot do this alone, and for which I need your support and most above, your indulgence and participation. With this message, I appeal to the youth of our nation to rise up and be aware of your rights and responsibilities. With the advent of technology, the digital mediums like this website or the social media platforms, enable us to exchange thoughts and ideas, in making this nation a global super power. Let us together build this nation forward. I espouse the belief of &ldquo;Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam&rdquo; which means the entire World is One Family. And hence I firmly believe that we all being a part of One Family, must work towards betterment of the nation, unitedly. Our Family needs us. Our nation needs us. </p>
          <p> Let us begin by identifying those problems across the nation, and by working towards finding solutions to eradicate them. Please write to me on <a href="mailto:onenation@dsc.com">onenation@dsc.com</a> and lets start this journey of a Better India! </p>
          <p> Yours truly,</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
